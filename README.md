# MadSpark Multi-Agent System

[![Phase](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phase-2.1%20Complete-success)](#project-status) [![Enhancement](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enhancement-Feedback%20Loop%20MERGED-brightgreen)](#feedback-loop-enhancement) [![Testing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Testing-95%25%20Coverage-success)](#testing) [![Next](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next-User%20Testing-blue)](#roadmap)

This project implements a sophisticated multi-agent system for idea generation and refinement using Google's Gemini API with advanced reasoning capabilities. It includes specialized agents for idea generation, criticism, advocacy, and skepticism, orchestrated by a coordinator enhanced with context-aware reasoning, logical inference, and multi-dimensional evaluation.

## 🚀 NEW: Feedback Loop Enhancement

The system now implements a **feedback loop mechanism** where agent outputs are used to generate improved ideas:

### Previous Flow (Static):
```
IdeaGen → Critic(score₁) → Advocate → Skeptic → [END - just display]
```

### New Flow (Dynamic Improvement):
```
IdeaGen → Critic(score₁) → Advocate → Skeptic → IdeaGen_v2 → Critic(score₂) → [Display with comparison]
```

### Key Features:
- **Structured Agent Outputs**: Advocate and Skeptic now output bullet-point lists for clear, actionable feedback
- **Idea Improvement**: Ideas are regenerated based on all agent feedback, maintaining strengths while addressing weaknesses
- **Score Comparison**: Visual comparison between original and improved scores with delta indicators
- **Transparent Process**: Users see both original and improved ideas with full critique history

### Example Output:
```
Original Idea: AI-powered personal assistant for elderly care
Score: 6.5/10

[Advocate Points] → [Skeptic Concerns] → [Improvement Process]

Improved Idea: Privacy-first AI companion with local processing and family oversight
Score: 8.2/10 (↑ +1.7 points, 26% improvement)
```

This enhancement addresses the limitation where valuable agent insights were only displayed without influencing the final output, resulting in more refined and robust ideas.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or newer (required for TypedDict and modern features)
- Access to Google Gemini API (recommended: gemini-2.5-flash)
- Optional: pytest for running tests, ruff for linting

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheIllusionOfLife/Eureka.git
   cd Eureka
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r config/requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Python path (required for the new structure):**
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)/src"  # On Windows: set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%cd%\src
   ```

5. **API Key Configuration:**
   Create a `.env` file in the `src/madspark/` directory:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
   GOOGLE_GENAI_MODEL="gemini-2.5-flash"
   ```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run the basic workflow
python -m madspark.core.coordinator

# Use the CLI interface
python -m madspark.cli.cli "Your theme" "Your constraints" --temperature 0.8

# Interactive mode
python -m madspark.cli.interactive_mode

# Web interface
cd web && docker-compose up
```

#### Next Priority Tasks

1. **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement user authentication system
   - Source: Security feedback from PR #95 (error stats endpoint needs auth)
   - Context: Current system lacks user authentication and access control
   - Approach: Implement JWT-based auth with FastAPI security utilities

2. **Production Configuration**: Update settings for production deployment
   - Source: CodeRabbit feedback from PR #95
   - Context: CORS origins hardcoded, logs need rotation, proxy headers needed
   - Approach: Use environment variables, implement log rotation, handle proxy IPs

3. **Duplicate Bookmark Detection**: Prevent duplicate bookmark submissions
   - Source: CodeRabbit identified duplicate entries in bookmarks.json
   - Context: No server-side duplicate detection currently exists
   - Approach: Implement content similarity checking before saving bookmarks

4. **Enhanced Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage for new features
   - Source: PR #95 review noted missing tests for new utilities
   - Context: New error handling, logging, and toast utilities lack tests
   - Approach: Use React Testing Library for frontend, pytest for backend

#### Session Learnings

- **Docker Dependency Resolution**: When containers have module issues, install inside container and use type workarounds for conflicting @types packages (from PR #95)
- **Systematic PR Reviews**: Follow the 4-Phase Review Protocol in `CLAUDE.md` to systematically find all feedback across the three GitHub API sources (PR comments, reviews, and line comments) (from PR #95)
- **Performance Stack**: GZip compression + pagination + memoization provides comprehensive performance optimization (from PR #95)
- **Error Architecture**: Centralized error handling with categorization enables consistent UX and debugging across the application (from PR #95)
- **TypeScript Module Resolution**: react-toastify v11 exports ToastOptions directly, avoiding need for @types package (from PR #95)
- **Strategic Fallback Logic**: Use `||` for required fields with min_length, `??` for numeric fields to preserve 0 values, and `||` for optional fields to convert empty strings to undefined (from PR #92)
- **FastAPI Exception Handling**: Use `RequestValidationError` not `ValidationError` for proper FastAPI validation error handling (from PR #92)
- **Security Logging**: Log only non-sensitive fields (`theme`, `tag count`) instead of full request objects to prevent data exposure (from PR #92)
