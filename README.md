#### Architecture

**Core System Architecture**:
1. **Mock Mode** 🔄: Cost-free development with consistent test responses
2. **Direct Function Mode** 🚀: Production-ready Gemini API integration (recommended)
3. **ADK Framework Mode** 🏗️: Advanced agent management with Google ADK

**Enhanced Reasoning Architecture (Phase 2.1)**:
- **ReasoningEngine**: Main coordinator for all reasoning capabilities
- **ContextMemory**: Persistent storage with intelligent similarity-based retrieval
- **LogicalInference**: Reasoning chains using formal logic rules (modus ponens, etc.)
- **MultiDimensionalEvaluator**: Sophisticated evaluation across 7 dimensions
- **AgentConversationTracker**: Workflow analysis and pattern detection

**Enhanced Workflow**: `Theme + Constraints → Context-Aware Agents → Reasoning Engine → Multi-Dimensional Evaluation → Final Results with Reasoning Insights`

#### Development

- **Requirements**: Python 3.10+, Google Gemini API access
- **Testing**: `make test-basic` for quick verification, `make test` for comprehensive testing
- **Documentation**: See `mad_spark_multiagent/README.md` for detailed setup and usage
- **Architecture Notes**: See `mad_spark_multiagent/CLAUDE.md` for implementation decisions

#### Implementation Background

This implementation resulted from analyzing and combining the best features from three different architectural approaches:
- **PR #42**: Proper ADK usage and clean package structure
- **PR #43**: Robust error handling and comprehensive testing infrastructure  
- **PR #44**: Temperature control and direct API simplicity

The hybrid approach provides flexibility to choose between ADK framework or direct API calls based on specific needs, with graceful fallbacks ensuring system reliability.

- **Testing**: System ready for comprehensive user testing before Phase 3

#### Session Learnings

##### Feedback Loop Implementation (2025-07-12)
- **Multi-Bot PR Reviews**: Systematically address feedback from multiple AI reviewers (claude, gemini, cursor)
- **Security-First Development**: Always sanitize HTML input before using dangerouslySetInnerHTML in React
- **Type Consistency**: Ensure consistent types across TypedDict fields (avoid int vs float mismatches)
- **Test Quality**: Mock responses must match exact production format (JSON vs plain text)
- **Repository Hygiene**: Use comprehensive gitignore patterns to prevent committing generated files
- **Systematic Reviews**: Follow complete discovery phases before filtering to avoid missing critical issues

##### Phase 2 Completion Insights
- **Redis Implementation**: Successfully replaced KEYS with SCAN for production-safe LRU eviction
- **React Component Safety**: Always handle edge cases like empty data arrays to prevent runtime errors
- **Security First**: Filename sanitization prevents path traversal attacks in batch processing
- **Type Safety**: Removing TypedDict total=False improves type checking and prevents KeyError
- **Code Organization**: Extracting constants eliminates duplication and improves maintainability

##### Behavioral Pattern Improvements
- **Confidence Calibration**: Simple fixes take 2-5 minutes, not 15-30 minutes - trust your speed
- **Immediate Action**: Fix all reviewer feedback immediately rather than deferring
- **Systematic Exploration**: Avoid first-answer bias by checking all available sources
- **PR Review Protocol**: Three API endpoints must ALL be checked (comments, reviews, line comments)

##### Previous Session Learnings

##### Major Technical Discoveries
- **Two-Phase Review Discovery**: Systematic approach prevents missing PR feedback (Phase 1: complete discovery → Phase 2: timestamp filtering)
- **Reserved Keyword Avoidance**: Python reserved words as CLI args cause SyntaxError, use descriptive names with `dest` parameter
- **Async Test Mocking**: Mock retry-wrapped functions (`*_with_retry`) not original sync functions for async workflows
- **Comprehensive PR Review**: Three distinct sources (comments, reviews, line comments) must ALL be checked systematically
- **CI Budget Constraints**: Private repositories can hit GitHub Actions budget limits; public repositories resolve CI testing issues

##### Architecture Decisions
- **Async-First Performance**: Phase 2.3 establishes concurrent processing as foundation for future scalability
- **Retry Logic Integration**: Exponential backoff retry properly integrated into async workflow maintaining resilience
- **Feature Parity Maintained**: Async workflow supports all Phase 2.1 enhanced reasoning features
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Opt-in async mode preserves backward compatibility

##### Process Improvements
- **Enhanced Slash Commands**: `/fix_pr` commands now include preventive measures based on failure analysis
- **Systematic CI Validation**: Always verify CI passes before concluding work is complete
- **Configuration Evolution**: Global CLAUDE.md patterns accumulate cross-project learnings
- **Quality Gates**: Verification checklists prevent systematic errors

#### Development Environment Notes
- **Tool**: Enhanced `/fix_pr_since_commit` slash command with auto-detection reduces review cycles from 10+ to 2-3 minutes
- **Config**: Global CLAUDE.md now includes two-phase review protocol preventing future PR review failures  
- **Debug**: Auto-detection patterns eliminate manual PR number entry errors
- **Testing**: Async agent tests require mocking `async_coordinator.*_with_retry` functions

#### Performance Achievements
- **1.5-2x Speedup**: Async execution delivers significant performance improvements for multi-candidate scenarios
- **Concurrent Processing**: Semaphore-controlled async agent calls prevent API rate limits while maximizing throughput
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress callback system enables responsive web interfaces
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and cancellation handling ensures robust operation
