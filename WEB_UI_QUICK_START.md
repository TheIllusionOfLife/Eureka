# MadSpark Web Interface - User Quick Start

Welcome! This guide helps you test the MadSpark Multi-Agent System through its web interface.

## 🚀 Super Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Start the Web Interface
```bash
cd mad_spark_multiagent/web
docker-compose up
```

### Step 2: Open Your Browser
Visit: **http://localhost:3000**

### Step 3: Test the System
1. **Theme**: Enter "AI-powered education tools"
2. **Constraints**: Enter "Affordable for schools, easy to implement, works on existing hardware"
3. **Creativity Level**: Select "Balanced" preset
4. **Enhanced Features**: ✓ Check "Enhanced Reasoning" and "Multi-Dimensional Evaluation"
5. **Generate**: Click "Generate Ideas" button

### Step 4: Explore Results
- View 2 generated ideas with scores
- See **Score Comparison** showing original vs improved ideas
- Click toggle buttons to expand:
  - 🔍 Initial Critique
  - ✅ Advocacy
  - ⚠️ Skeptical Analysis  
  - 📊 Multi-Dimensional Evaluation (radar chart)

## ✨ What You'll See

### Feedback Loop Enhancement (NEW!)
- **Before/After Scores**: Original idea (6.6/10) → Improved idea (8.0/10)
- **Improvement Metrics**: +1.4 points (21% improvement)
- **Visual Indicators**: Green arrows showing score improvements

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis
- **7-Dimension Radar Chart**: Feasibility, Innovation, Impact, Cost-Effectiveness, Scalability, Risk, Timeline
- **Detailed Scores**: Each dimension rated 0-10 with explanations
- **Confidence Intervals**: Score ranges showing uncertainty

### Real-Time Progress
- **WebSocket Updates**: Live progress bar during generation
- **Stage Indicators**: Initialize → Generate → Evaluate → Complete
- **Time Stamps**: Completion tracking

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If the interface doesn't load:
```bash
# Check backend health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# Check frontend is running
curl http://localhost:3000
```

### If generation fails:
- Ensure you have a valid GOOGLE_API_KEY in your `.env` file
- Check Docker logs: `docker logs web-backend-1`
- Verify all containers are running: `docker-compose ps`

### If you see WebSocket errors:
- These are normal during processing and should resolve automatically
- The system will still generate results even with minor WebSocket issues

## 🎯 Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Test Different Creativity Levels:
1. **Conservative** (0.3): Safe, proven ideas
2. **Balanced** (0.7): Mix of creativity and feasibility  
3. **Creative** (0.9): Innovative, experimental concepts
4. **Wild** (1.0): Highly creative, unconventional ideas

### Test Enhanced Features:
- **Enhanced Reasoning**: Context-aware agent decisions
- **Multi-Dimensional Eval**: 7-dimension analysis with radar charts
- **Logical Inference**: Formal reasoning chains with confidence scoring
- **Novelty Filter**: Duplicate detection (adjust similarity threshold)

### Test Different Themes:
- "Sustainable urban farming" + "Small spaces, minimal water usage"
- "Remote work productivity" + "Budget-friendly, home office setup"  
- "Mental health support" + "Accessible, privacy-focused solutions"

## 📚 More Information

- **Detailed Setup**: See `/mad_spark_multiagent/web/README.md`
- **CLI Usage**: See `/mad_spark_multiagent/README.md`
