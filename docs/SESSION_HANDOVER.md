# Session Handover

### Last Updated: 2025-07-14T15:45+09:00

This document tracks recent development sessions, completed work, and next priorities for the MadSpark project.

## Recently Completed

- ✅ **PR #82**: Complete repository reorganization to professional Python package structure
  - Transformed `mad_spark_multiagent/` to `src/madspark/` layout
  - Fixed all import issues and verified functionality
  - Added basic test infrastructure
  - Updated documentation for new structure
- ✅ **Critical Bug Fixes**: Addressed all reviewer feedback from multiple AI reviewers
  - Fixed import script tool bugs
  - Enhanced WebSocket exception handling
  - Resolved ID shadowing issues
  - Updated README for accuracy

## Next Priority Tasks

1. **Comprehensive Test Suite Migration**
   - Source: PR #82 review noted minimal test files
   - Context: Tests exist but weren't moved to new structure
   - Approach: Migrate test files from old location if found, or recreate comprehensive test suite

2. **Web Interface Import Verification**
   - Source: Fixed imports during session but needs thorough testing
   - Context: Web backend imports were updated for new structure
   - Approach: Full end-to-end testing of web interface functionality

3. **Documentation Consolidation**
   - Source: Multiple documentation files scattered across directories
   - Context: Docs moved but could be better organized
   - Approach: Create comprehensive documentation structure

## Known Issues / Blockers

- **Test Infrastructure**: Only basic import tests present, full test suite needs migration
- **Documentation**: Some docs may be outdated after reorganization

## Session Learnings

- **PR Review Protocol**: Systematic 4-phase approach prevents missing reviewer feedback
- **Import Management**: Try/except fallback patterns essential for multi-environment compatibility
- **Repository Structure**: Standard `src/` layout improves professionalism and tooling compatibility
- **False Alarm Pattern**: Automated reviewers may misunderstand valid Python import patterns
