## Why These Were Archived

These documents were moved to the archive for one or more of the following reasons:

1. **Completed Work**: Implementation plans for features that have been fully implemented
2. **Historical Reference**: Session summaries and handovers that are no longer current
3. **Obsolete**: Documentation that has been superseded by newer, more comprehensive guides
4. **Reduced Redundancy**: Content that overlapped significantly with current documentation

## Archive Policy

Documents are archived rather than deleted to:
- Preserve project history
- Provide context for future development decisions
- Maintain references for understanding past architectural choices
- Enable recovery of information if needed
