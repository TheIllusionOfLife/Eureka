This project implements a sophisticated multi-agent system for idea generation and refinement using Google's Gemini API with advanced reasoning capabilities. It includes specialized agents for idea generation, criticism, advocacy, and skepticism, orchestrated by a coordinator enhanced with context-aware reasoning, logical inference, and multi-dimensional evaluation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer (required for TypedDict and modern features)
- Access to Google Gemini API (recommended: gemini-1.5-flash or gemini-pro)
- Optional: pytest for running tests, ruff for linting

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable).**
    If you have cloned a repository containing this project, navigate into the `mad_spark_multiagent` directory. If you received the files directly, ensure they are all within a directory named `mad_spark_multiagent`.

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    From within the `mad_spark_multiagent` directory:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **API Key Configuration:**
    This application requires a Google API Key for accessing the configured generative models.
    - Create a file named `.env` in the `mad_spark_multiagent` project directory (i.e., alongside `coordinator.py`).
    - Add your API key and the model name to the `.env` file. For example:
      ```env
      GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      GOOGLE_GENAI_MODEL="gemini-pro"
      ```
      Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key. You can choose a different model compatible with the Google AI SDK if desired (e.g., "gemini-1.5-flash-latest").

    **Important Security Note:** Storing API keys in `.env` files is suitable for local development. For production environments, it is strongly recommended to use a dedicated secret management service (e.g., Google Cloud Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault) to protect your API keys. Do not commit `.env` files containing sensitive keys to version control (the provided `.gitignore` file in the parent directory should prevent this if this project is part of a larger repository structure, or you should ensure a local `.gitignore` also lists `.env`).

## Running the System

The main coordinator script can be run to test the workflow:
From within the `mad_spark_multiagent` directory:
```bash
python coordinator.py
```
This will use the sample `theme` and `constraints` defined in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block of `coordinator.py`. You can modify these to test different scenarios. The output will be a JSON representation of the processed ideas.

## Project Structure

- `agent_defs/`: Contains the definitions for individual agents (`idea_generator.py`, `critic.py`, `advocate.py`, `skeptic.py`).
  - `__init__.py`: Exports the agent instances.
- `coordinator.py`: Orchestrates the agents and manages the overall workflow.
- `enhanced_reasoning.py`: **NEW Phase 2.1** - Advanced reasoning system with context awareness and logical inference.
- `cli.py`: Comprehensive command-line interface with all features.
- `tests/`: Comprehensive test suite including enhanced reasoning tests.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies (`google-generativeai`, `python-dotenv`, `pytest`).
- `.env` (create this file locally, gitignored): For storing your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_GENAI_MODEL`.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How it Works

1.  The `Coordinator` (`coordinator.py`) takes a `theme` and `constraints` (both strings) as input.
2.  The `IdeaGeneratorAgent` (`agent_defs/idea_generator.py`) generates a list of ideas based on this input.
3.  The `CriticAgent` (`agent_defs/critic.py`) evaluates these ideas, providing a score (1-10) and a textual comment for each. The evaluations are requested as newline-separated JSON strings.
4.  The `Coordinator` parses these evaluations. If parsing fails for an idea, defaults are used, and a warning is logged. It then selects the top-scoring ideas (default is top 2, configurable).
5.  For each selected top idea:
    - The `AdvocateAgent` (`agent_defs/advocate.py`) generates arguments highlighting the idea's strengths and potential.
    - The `SkepticAgent` (`agent_defs/skeptic.py`) critically analyzes the idea and its advocacy, pointing out potential weaknesses or risks.
    - Failures in advocacy or skepticism for one idea are logged as warnings, and placeholder text is used, allowing the workflow to continue for other ideas.
6.  The `Coordinator` compiles and returns (prints as JSON) the final list of candidates with all collected information (original idea, score, critique, advocacy, and skepticism).
7.  Critical errors, such as failure to generate any initial ideas or a complete failure of the critic agent, will result in an empty list of results. API key and model configuration issues are checked before agent initialization and will cause the script to exit with an error if not configured.

## Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
# Install test dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=mad_spark_multiagent

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_utils.py

# Run tests in verbose mode
pytest -v
```

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for utility functions (JSON parsing, retry logic)
- Integration tests for the coordinator workflow
- Tests for agent initialization and tool functions
- Mock-based testing to avoid actual API calls

## Lessons Learned: Verbose Logging Implementation (PR #56)

This section documents key insights from developing the production verbose logging feature to prevent future development issues.

### 🚨 **Critical Issues Encountered & Solutions**

#### **1. Logging Configuration Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Module-level `logging.basicConfig()` in `coordinator.py` prevented CLI's verbose logging setup
- **Root Cause**: Python's logging system ignores subsequent `basicConfig()` calls after the first one
- **Solution**: 
  - Remove module-level logging configuration from imported modules
  - Use `force=True` parameter in `logging.basicConfig()`
  - Clear existing handlers before reconfiguration
- **Prevention**: Always configure logging at the application entry point, not in imported modules

#### **2. Incomplete PR Review Retrieval**
- **Problem**: Failed to get complete review content from GitHub CLI, missing critical issues
- **Root Cause**: Output truncation and incorrect command usage
- **Solution**: Systematic approach using JSON output and jq parsing
- **Prevention**: Added comprehensive PR review guidelines to global CLAUDE.md

#### **3. Test Coverage Gaps**
- **Problem**: Initial implementation lacked tests for verbose functionality
- **Root Cause**: Focused on feature implementation without TDD approach
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive test suite with CLI integration, error handling, and performance tests
- **Prevention**: Always follow TDD approach - write tests first, then implementation

### 📋 **Development Process Improvements**

#### **Systematic Review Response Process**
1. **Complete Content Retrieval**: Use `gh pr view {PR} --json reviews | jq '.reviews | reverse'`
2. **Issue Categorization**: Separate critical vs. minor issues before addressing
3. **Verification**: Confirm all review content retrieved before proceeding
4. **Progressive Addressing**: Handle critical issues first, then minor improvements

#### **Code Quality Best Practices**
- **Early Exit Patterns**: Use `if not verbose: return` to optimize performance
- **Helper Function Extraction**: Reduce code duplication with reusable utilities
- **Error Handling**: Always include graceful fallbacks for external dependencies
- **Documentation**: Include production best practices, not just usage examples

### 🔧 **Technical Insights**

#### **Logging Architecture**
- **Centralized Configuration**: Handle all logging setup in main application entry point
- **Graceful Degradation**: Provide console-only fallback when file logging fails
- **Performance Optimization**: Use early exits and efficient string building
- **Security Considerations**: Document sensitive data handling in log files

#### **Testing Strategy**
- **Multiple Test Types**: Unit tests, integration tests, CLI tests, and performance tests

### 🚀 **Future Development Guidelines**

1. **Always start with comprehensive PR review content retrieval**
2. **Follow TDD approach: tests first, implementation second**
3. **Include error handling and graceful fallbacks from the beginning**
4. **Document production considerations alongside implementation**
5. **Use helper functions to reduce code duplication early**
6. **Test across multiple scenarios including error conditions**
7. **Address all reviewer feedback systematically with verification**

This implementation serves as a template for future feature development with enterprise-grade quality standards.
