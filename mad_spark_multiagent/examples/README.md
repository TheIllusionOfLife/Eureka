## üöÄ Quick Start with Enhanced Reasoning

### 1. Basic Enhanced Reasoning
```bash
cd ..  # Go to main directory
python cli.py "Smart cities" "Sustainable solutions" --enhanced-reasoning --verbose
```

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Evaluation
```bash
python cli.py "Healthcare innovation" "Rural deployment" --multi-dimensional-eval --verbose
```

### 3. Full Enhanced Suite
```bash
python cli.py "AI applications" "Ethical, beneficial" --enhanced-reasoning --multi-dimensional-eval --verbose
```

## üìä Understanding Multi-Dimensional Scores

Traditional scoring gives a single 1-10 score. Multi-dimensional evaluation provides:

- **Overall Score**: Simple average across all dimensions
- **Weighted Score**: Dimension weights applied (used for ranking)
- **Dimension Breakdown**: Individual scores for each of the 7 dimensions
- **Confidence Interval**: Reliability measure based on score variance
- **Evaluation Summary**: Natural language explanation of the scoring

Example output:
```
üìä Multi-Dimensional Score for 'AI-powered diagnostic tool...': 7.85
   Confidence: 0.892

üß† Enhanced Analysis:
Strong feasibility (8.5) due to existing AI infrastructure. High innovation (9.0) 
with novel diagnostic approach. Excellent impact potential (8.8) for rural healthcare.
Cost-effectiveness (7.2) reasonable with development investment...
```

## üîç Debugging and Development

### Running Individual Components

Test the enhanced reasoning engine directly:
```bash
python -c "
from enhanced_reasoning import ReasoningEngine
engine = ReasoningEngine()
print('‚úÖ Enhanced reasoning engine initialized')
print(f'Memory capacity: {engine.context_memory.capacity}')
print(f'Evaluation dimensions: {len(engine.multi_evaluator.evaluation_dimensions)}')
"
```

### Verbose Mode Analysis

Enhanced reasoning generates extensive verbose output:
- Context initialization messages
- Multi-dimensional evaluation progress
- Detailed scoring breakdowns
- Reasoning chain explanations

Use `--verbose` flag to see the complete enhanced reasoning process.

### Error Handling

Enhanced reasoning includes graceful fallbacks:
- If enhanced reasoning fails, falls back to standard evaluation
- Context memory errors don't break main workflow
- Multi-dimensional evaluation errors revert to simple scoring

## üéØ Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Context memory stores up to 1000 interaction contexts
- **Processing Time**: Multi-dimensional evaluation adds ~2-3 seconds per idea
- **API Costs**: Enhanced reasoning uses same API calls, just processes differently
- **Accuracy**: Multi-dimensional evaluation typically provides more accurate scoring

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Features

Enhanced reasoning works seamlessly with all Phase 1 features:

- **Temperature Control**: Enhanced reasoning respects temperature settings
- **Novelty Filter**: Works on enhanced-evaluated ideas
- **Bookmark System**: Can bookmark enhanced reasoning results
- **CLI Interface**: All CLI features available with enhanced reasoning

## üìà Future Enhancements

Phase 2.2 and beyond may include:
- Cross-session context persistence
- Advanced inference rule customization
- Integration with external knowledge bases
- Real-time learning from user feedback

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

1. **Use multi-dimensional evaluation for important decisions**
2. **Enable enhanced reasoning for complex, nuanced topics**
3. **Combine with creative temperature presets for innovation**
4. **Use verbose mode to understand reasoning process**
5. **Bookmark enhanced results for future reference**

The enhanced reasoning system represents a significant advancement in AI-powered idea generation and evaluation, providing unprecedented insight into the decision-making process of the MadSpark multi-agent system.
