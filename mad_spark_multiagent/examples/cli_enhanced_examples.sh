# Multi-dimensional evaluation
echo -e "\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Dimensional Evaluation:"
echo "python cli.py \"Healthcare innovation\" \"Rural areas, low-cost\" --multi-dimensional-eval --verbose"

# Combined enhanced features
echo -e "\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Full Enhanced Reasoning Suite:"
echo "python cli.py \"Sustainable agriculture\" \"Climate-resilient\" --enhanced-reasoning --multi-dimensional-eval --verbose"

# Enhanced reasoning with temperature control
echo -e "\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced Reasoning + Creative Temperature:"
echo "python cli.py \"AI applications\" \"Ethical, beneficial\" --enhanced-reasoning --temperature-preset creative"

# Enhanced reasoning with bookmark integration
echo -e "\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced Reasoning + Bookmark Results:"
echo "python cli.py \"Green energy\" \"Community-scale\" --multi-dimensional-eval --bookmark-results --bookmark-tags enhanced-reasoning renewable"

# Comparison mode - run both standard and enhanced
echo -e "\n6Ô∏è‚É£ Comparison: Standard vs Enhanced"
echo "# Standard reasoning:"
echo "python cli.py \"Urban planning\" \"Smart cities\" --num-candidates 3"
echo "# Enhanced reasoning:"
echo "python cli.py \"Urban planning\" \"Smart cities\" --num-candidates 3 --enhanced-reasoning --multi-dimensional-eval"

echo -e "\nüéØ Key Benefits of Enhanced Reasoning:"
echo "- Context awareness across agent interactions"
echo "- 7-dimension evaluation (feasibility, innovation, impact, cost, scalability, risk, timeline)"
echo "- Logical inference chains for better decision making"
echo "- Agent memory for improved consistency"
echo "- Enhanced critique quality with detailed analysis"

echo -e "\nüìä Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Dimensions:"
echo "1. Feasibility - How realistic is implementation"
echo "2. Innovation - How novel and creative is the idea"
echo "3. Impact - Potential positive impact magnitude"
echo "4. Cost Effectiveness - Resource efficiency and ROI"
echo "5. Scalability - Ability to scale up"
echo "6. Risk Assessment - Risk level evaluation"
echo "7. Timeline - Implementation timeline feasibility"

echo -e "\nüí° Pro Tips:"
echo "- Use --verbose to see detailed enhanced reasoning output"
echo "- Combine with temperature presets for optimal creativity"
echo "- Bookmark enhanced results for future remix"
echo "- Multi-dimensional evaluation provides richer insights than standard scoring"
