## Solution
1. Automated Ollama Library Import & Dependency Validation Suite: Develop an automated test suite that specifically targets the `import ollama` statement and its immediate dependencies. This suite would run in isolated environments (e.g., Docker containers with different Python versions and OS configurations) to verify successful library import, detect missing or incompatible dependencies, and ensure core functionalities are accessible post-import without runtime errors. It provides quick feedback on potential environment-specific import failures. Key features: Multi-Python version compatibility testing, Cross-OS environment simulation (Linux, Windows, macOS), Dependency graph analysis for conflicts, Automated virtual environment creation and cleanup, Pass/fail reporting for import success
