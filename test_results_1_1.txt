NOTE: This file originally contained an error from the initial test attempt:
  (eval):1: command not found: PYTHONPATH=src

This error occurred due to zsh shell syntax. The test was subsequently re-run
successfully using the corrected command:
  source .env 2>/dev/null && export PYTHONPATH=src && python -m madspark.cli.cli ...

The successful test output was observed in the terminal but not saved to this file.
