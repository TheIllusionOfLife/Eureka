## Solution
Intelligent Adaptive Image Delivery System with Hybrid Processing and Progressive Streaming: Implement a robust, multi-stage system for large image optimization, leveraging a hybrid approach to derivative generation and delivery. Upon upload, a critical-path, lightweight, and *losslessly* compressed placeholder (e.g., BlurHash, tiny WebP/AVIF thumbnail, or SVG-encoded) is immediately generated and stored, enabling near-instant initial display. Concurrently, a serverless-orchestrated, asynchronous background process intelligently generates a comprehensive suite of perceptually optimized multi-resolution and adaptive-quality derivatives and tiles (using modern codecs like AVIF/WebP), prioritizing frequently accessed resolutions and employing 'Just-In-Time' (JIT) dynamic generation for deep-zoom or rarely requested tiles to mitigate storage explosion and server-side bottlenecks. 

The client-side employs a standardized, modular framework that dynamically selects the optimal delivery strategy: for very fast connections, it may default to a highly optimized, single full image download; otherwise, it utilizes progressive streaming with viewport-aware adaptive tiling. This framework performs real-time network and device capability detection, intelligently pre-fetches adjacent tiles based on user interaction (scroll/zoom intent), and gracefully degrades quality or adjusts pre-fetching on lower-end devices or poor networks. Smooth transitions between resolutions are achieved through subtle cross-fading or GPU-accelerated blending, avoiding 'pop-in' artifacts. 

Robust caching is implemented at the CDN level using content-addressable URLs (hash-based versioning) for all derivatives, simplifying cache invalidation to merely updating the reference URL. For SEO and accessibility, the server provides initial `<picture>` elements with `srcset` and `sizes` for crawlers and uses `alt` attributes, with `noscript` fallbacks. Comprehensive cost analysis informs storage tiering and compute resource allocation, while built-in error handling includes client-side retry mechanisms for failed tiles, graceful fallback to a single optimized image on persistent failure, and server-side monitoring. Security is ensured through input validation, secure endpoints, and access controls for all generated assets.
